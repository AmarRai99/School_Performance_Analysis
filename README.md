# Using Pandas to analyze the district-wide standardized test results for schools in the education sector


# Background
Analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Access has been given to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


# District Summary
Created a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame, of the district's key metrics, including the following:

• Total schools
• Total students
• Total budget
• Average math score
• Average reading score
• % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
• % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
• % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
